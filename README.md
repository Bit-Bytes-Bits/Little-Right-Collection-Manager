## Description
This is a website demonstration build for my phase 1 independent project.  
The MVP for this project that has been met is sections holding different clothing  categories.   



## Project Build Up

             Project is created in:

- `HTML` - Used to build the structure of the webpage.
- `CSS` - Used to apply style to the site.
- `JavaScript` - To make the web page interactive.
- `JSON` - The project uses a json file named *desinerShop.json* that stores the various assets used in the page.

## Requirements
- A computer that has the following installed:
    * Visual studio code with the following extensions and library:  

          * Code Runner.
          * Live Server.
          * Prettier formater.
    * Node JS should be installed prior to executing the codes on your computer.
    * JSON server 

        * How to install JSON server:
         
            ### `npm install -g json-server`
        * How to run JSON server (Ensure you are at the root directory when running this command)
        
            ### `json-server --watch designerShop.json`


* A working internet connection.

It is worthy to note that the images are not displayed on the live link because the json server is only running on a local environment.
